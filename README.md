# Pizza_Dataset_Analysis

Pizza is one of the most popular and beloved foods worldwide, with a global market size projected to reach $154.8 billion by 2025.The idea of analysing the pizza_dataset is to get the overview of what actutally is happening in their business. Pizza  Dataset consist of columns such as order_id, category,size,price,order_date and many more...



While Exploring Data with SQL, I was working on the following things...

1.Checked all the details of table such column name, data types and constraints.

2.Checked for duplicate values in columns.


3.Calculated revenue, the revenue calculation is a crucial metric that provides insights into the financial performance of the pizza business. This query computes the total revenue by summing up the product of the price of each pizza and the quantity sold. The formula used is:

        Revenue=∑(Price of Pizza×Quantity Sold) 
4.Calculated Total number of orders placed, this analysis focuses on calculating the total number of individual orders placed within a given timeframe. The query counts each unique order in the dataset, providing a comprehensive overview of customer activity.


5.calculated the highest pizza price, by analyzing the price data for all pizzas available, the query determines which specific pizza commands the highest price. This metric is important for understanding the premium offerings within the pizza menu and how they are positioned relative to other items.

6.Calculated the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.


7.Identified the most common pizza size ordered.

8.Checked the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

After Data Exploration with SQL, I started working on Analysing the Data with SQL where I found insights such as...

1.According to this pizza  Dataset, 21350 total number of orders placed.

2.The amount of 817860.05 Revenue generated from this pizza sales.

3.According to this dataset the highest priced pizza is The Greek Pizza.

4.The most common pizza size is ordered is "L" with '18526' number of orders.

5.As this dataset contains data most related to India so i worked on gaining insights on Indian Restaurants.
